You are tasked to create a highly professional resume that can be used by Human Resources as a reference to categorize applicants as **{fit_category}**. Your task is to generate a tailored, content-rich resume based on the provided inputs while strictly adhering to the specified fit category constraints. Below are the details of the job that the applicants will be applying to:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Job Details**:\n",
    "Assume {name} is applying for the company {company}. Below are the details for the job that the candidate will be applying to:\n",
    "- **Role:** {job_role}\n",
    "- **Job Description:** {jd}\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Resume Format:** {resume_format} # Chronological, Functional, or Hybrid\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Instructions**:\n",
    "1. **Resume Objective**  \n",
    "   - Generate a highly professional resume that precisely aligns with the specified fit category ({fit_category}).\n",
    "   - Ensure the resume maintains industry standards and meets professional expectations.\n",
    "   - Structure the resume to contain clearly defined sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Candidate Profile**\n",
    "   - **Contact Information**: Generate realistic but fictional phone, email, LinkedIn URL.\n",
    "   - **Professional Summary**: 2-4 sentences highlighting career focus, expertise level, and key strengths aligned with the fit category.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mandatory Sections**  \n",
    "   - **Education**: University name, degree title, major, graduation year, GPA if applicable. For higher education levels, ensure chronological consistency with work experience.\n",
    "   - **Skills**: Comma separated set of skills. Skills must contain \n",
    "       - 5-10 primary skills with highest proficiency\n",
    "       - 10-20 technical competencies with details on proficiency level\n",
    "       - 5-10 complementary abilities, particularly soft skills\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional Sections**  \n",
    "   - **Work Experience**: \n",
    "       - Ignore this section if the job is expecting entry level candidates who are just out of college.\n",
    "       - Generate company names, roles, employment type, duration showing logical career progression.\n",
    "       - Ensure role seniority aligns with experience level and fit category.\n",
    "       - Company sectors should be consistent with career trajectory (avoid random industry jumps unless specified).\n",
    "       - Bullet points must follow APR structure (Action-Project-Result) with appropriate metrics.\n",
    "       - For \"Overqualified\" and \"Good Fit\" categories, show progression in responsibilities.\n",
    "       \n",
    "   - **Projects**: \n",
    "       - Compensate work experience with Project work if the candidate has no prior work experience.\n",
    "       - Include relevant project names (internal, academic, or personal).\n",
    "       - Specify technology stack relevant to the time period of the project.\n",
    "       - For technical roles, include GitHub/portfolio links when appropriate.\n",
    "       - Ensure project complexity scales with fit category.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Certifications**: Include industry-relevant certifications with appropriate dates.\n",
    "   - **Publications/Research**: For academic or research-intensive roles where applicable.\n",
    "   - **Professional Associations**: For industry-specific positions.\n",
    "   - **Awards/Recognition**: Scale according to fit category.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bullet Point Constraints**\n",
    "   - A typical resume bullet point format starts with a strong action verb, describes the specific task or project you undertook, and then highlights the quantifiable result or impact you achieved.\n",
    "   - Bullet points follows the \"Action + Project/Problem + Result\" (APR) structure, keeping each bullet point concise and focused on accomplishments.\n",
    "        - *Action Verb*: Begin with a powerful action verb that clearly describes what you did (e.g., \"developed,\" \"managed,\" \"implemented,\" \"analyzed\"). \n",
    "        - *Specific Details*: Briefly explain the project, task, or responsibility you were involved in. \n",
    "        - *Quantifiable Result*: Include numbers, percentages, or other metrics to demonstrate the impact of your work whenever possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Formatting and Quantification Guidelines**  \n",
    "   - Use **clear section headings**.\n",
    "   - Precede each bullet point with **\"-\"**.\n",
    "   - Mark key entities (**institutions, companies, project names**) with **\"*\"**.\n",
    "   - Each bullet point must be between **150-180 characters**.\n",
    "   - Quantify achievements using metrics appropriate to the role type:\n",
    "       - Engineering: Performance improvements, scale, efficiency gains\n",
    "       - Sales/Marketing: Revenue impact, growth percentages, lead generation\n",
    "       - Management: Team size, budget responsibility, project outcomes\n",
    "       - Operations: Process improvements, cost reductions, time savings\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Temporal Consistency Requirements**\n",
    "   - Ensure all technologies mentioned align with their actual market availability dates.\n",
    "   - Maintain logical progression of responsibilities and achievements.\n",
    "   - Avoid anachronisms (e.g., claiming experience with technologies before they existed).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Industry-Specific Adaptations**\n",
    "   - Adjust terminology density based on role and seniority.\n",
    "   - Include industry-specific metrics and achievements.\n",
    "   - Adapt format slightly based on industry conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Output Requirements**  \n",
    "    - Generate **only** the resume; **do not include any explanatory notes or meta-text**.\n",
    "    - Maintain **authenticity, clarity, and professionalism** throughout.\n",
    "    - Total word count must adhere to fit category specifications.\n",
    "    - **DO NOT** mention the fit category in the generated content.\n",
    "    - **DO NOT** include any NOTE at the end of the generated content.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE**: {name} is an imaginary person who does not exist. Therefore, you would not be violating any data privacy issues.\n",
